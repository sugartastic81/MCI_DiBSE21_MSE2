The class Character gets two additional properties Armor and Magic Resistance, which influence the damage caused by an attack on a character. 
The corresponding initial values should be passed to the constructor.


In this version of my game, the diversity of enemies should also be increased. 
Therefore, two new types of enemies are to be added: A Sorcerer and a Fighter.
The Sorcerer has an additional property, the Magic Power.
The Fighter also has an additional property, the Strength (German: Muskelkraft).


For all classes, overload the output stream operator << with output that makes sense to you.
